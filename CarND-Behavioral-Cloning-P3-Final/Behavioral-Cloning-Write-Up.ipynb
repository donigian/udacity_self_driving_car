    "The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was iterative. My first step after downloading the simulator, was to drive the vehicle manually for a few laps to get a feel for the controls and get better at track 1. My ability to manually drive the vehicle would be porportional to the quality of the training samples produced. I recorded one lap for an initial end to end test scenario prior to implementing the full CNN architecture.\n",
